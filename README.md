This is gong to be a simple project using the [JSON-webserver](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) for a backend and react as the front end. eventually i plan to build a fully functioning REST Node API to deploy this but for now this project is to further gain experience in React leveraging Redux and app level state as well as to familiarize myself with [MATERIAL-UI](https://material-ui.com/) and its usage
